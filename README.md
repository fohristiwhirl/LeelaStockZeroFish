# LeelaStockZeroFish

The software behind https://lichess.org/@/LeelaStockZeroFish

How it works: LZ is asked for a move, and SF can veto it if it thinks it's terrible (for some definition of "terrible").

TODO:

* Use `searchpos` and dispense with MultiPV
* Fold in minor improvements from [here](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/simple_lichess_bridge).
