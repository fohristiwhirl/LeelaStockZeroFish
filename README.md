# LeelaStockZeroFish

The software behind https://lichess.org/@/LeelaStockZeroFish

When running there I'm limited by my bad graphics card; I'd be curious how someone else would do with better hardware.

Requires Python 3.6 (just for the f-strings; could be made compatible with earlier Pythons fairly easily).
